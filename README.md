# The first script creates fake patient datasets. The first patient dataset has 'baked-in' correlation by design....I forced correlation to exist between some variables whereas the second fake patient dataset does not have any 'baked-in' correlation and any correlations would be spurious.
# The second script demonstrates how to perform logistic regression on the 2 fake datasets from script 1.
# The third script demonstrates how to build random forest models from 200 to 2000 trees in depth and how to use Mean Decrease in Accuracy (>=10) as a cutoff for feature selection.
